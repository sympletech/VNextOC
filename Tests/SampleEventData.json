This presentation will detail the infiltration of both the Default Culture and The Booted by one individual, with accompanying biases, personality and emotions.

Gone are the days of single-tier, battle-ship gray, boring user <br \/>\n\ninterfaces. Users demand that your applications (or portions) run on more than <br \/>\n\none device. This session will take you on a tour of how you should be architecting your application by breaking it up into services. You will learn how <br \/>\n\nto create your business rules and data layer as a service. This seminar will <br \/>\n\nassume you have some knowledge of .NET but have been developing <br \/>\n\napplications the old way and you are now looking to see how to use WCF and <br \/>\n\nthe Model-View-View-Model (MVVM) design pattern to create applications that <br \/>\n\ncan be run one more than one user interface platform. This session has many <br \/>\n\ndemonstrations and you will be led step-by-step through the code.
