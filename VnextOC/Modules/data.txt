            "description": "<p><strong>Talk Info :</strong></p>\n<p>The techniques for building applications have changed dramatically in the last <br />\n\nfew years. Gone are the days of single-tier, battle-ship gray, boring user <br />\n\ninterfaces. Users demand that your applications (or portions) run on more than <br />\n\none device. This session will take you on a tour of how you should be architecting your application by breaking it up into services. You will learn how <br />\n\nto create your business rules and data layer as a service. This seminar will <br />\n\nassume you have some knowledge of .NET but have been developing <br />\n\napplications the old way and you are now looking to see how to use WCF and <br />\n\nthe Model-View-View-Model (MVVM) design pattern to create applications that <br />\n\ncan be run one more than one user interface platform. This session has many <br />\n\ndemonstrations and you will be led step-by-step through the code. You will walk <br />\n\naway with a sample set of services that run on Silverlight, Windows Forms, <br />\n\nWPF, Windows Phone and ASP.NET.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>About The Speaker</strong></p>\n<p>Paul D.
