	Title:  My Experience with the Booted, The Borg and Default Culture
	Speaker: Jon Jorgensen 
	Time: 8/14/2013 6:00:00 PM
	Description: <p><span style="color : #1f497d">Developing software in large, conservative corporations in the US can be a sub-optimal experience when the humanity of team members is denied in the name of “professionalism” or the prevailing corporate culture.  Counter-culture movements are often misperceived or mislabeled as non-conducive to business activity.  In such a setting, known as the “Default Culture” The Booted have been seeking ways to spread virally and overwrite the default culture towards making a better world with great software. This presentation will detail the infiltration of both the Default Culture and The Booted by one individual, with accompanying biases, personality and emotions. The subjective treatment of the topic by the presenter or attendees may be disturbing to more rigid adherents of default culture.  We offer our semi-sincere apologies in advance and encourage proactive self-selection.</span></p>

	Title:  Architecting Applications for Multiple User Interfaces
	Speaker: Paul D. Sheriff 
	Time: 9/11/2013 6:00:00 PM
	Description: <p><strong>Talk Info :</strong></p>
<p>The techniques for building applications have changed dramatically in the last <br />

few years. Gone are the days of single-tier, battle-ship gray, boring user <br />

interfaces. Users demand that your applications (or portions) run on more than <br />

one device. This session will take you on a tour of how you should be architecting your application by breaking it up into services. You will learn how <br />

to create your business rules and data layer as a service. This seminar will <br />

assume you have some knowledge of .NET but have been developing <br />

applications the old way and you are now looking to see how to use WCF and <br />

the Model-View-View-Model (MVVM) design pattern to create applications that <br />

can be run one more than one user interface platform. This session has many <br />

demonstrations and you will be led step-by-step through the code. You will walk <br />

away with a sample set of services that run on Silverlight, Windows Forms, <br />

WPF, Windows Phone and ASP.NET.</p>
